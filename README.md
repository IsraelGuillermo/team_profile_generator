## Description

![Application](./images/application.png)

This project is a backend program which allows the user to generate a profile for their team. This program is written using Node CLI. The program is designed for a manager to input the names, employee ID, email and school(for interns) or Github IDs(for engineers).
<br />
This tool helps managers manage their team by listing this information. The program then generates an HTML page with the information which is submitted by the manager. The program also uses NPM Inquirer to prompt information and ask for employee information which includes email, id, office number, school, Github and email.
